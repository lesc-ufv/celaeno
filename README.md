## Who Am I?

<img align="left" width="200px" src="doc/character/character.png"/>

Hello there, my name is **Celaeno**, have you heard of the amazing world of
Field-Coupled Nanocomputing? You can have an overview of the subject
in this [link](#).

Completely written using generic programming in C++, I offer a collection
of algorithms of general purpose usages; i.e. heuristics, meta-heuristics,
graph partitioning, and more.

All the algorithms are completely written using generic C++ programming,
you can use them as you would normally use a standard library algorithm.

I was written following the project guidelines from my friend,
[Anubis](https://formigoni.gitlab.io/anubis/), he is not so scary,
and can guide you to follow consistent project conventions throughout
your C++ project.


## Functionalities

You can read the full api documentation in my [gitlab pages](#).

For a quick summary, here's my list of implemented algorithms:
